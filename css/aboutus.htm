           <h3><ul>Social Dance & Ballroom Etiquette for Young People</ul></h3>
<p>The main focus of Piedmont Cotillions is to encourage young people to become confident and to build self esteem.</p>
<p>This program introduces the importance of social graces such as the proper way to move through a receiving line, make introductions and converse comfortably, invite a lady to dance, stand when a lady enters the room, write thank you notes, use proper telephone etiquette, open doors for a lady and much more.</p>
<p>Making friends is very important to young people, but this is not always easy.  All young people want to feel accepted, but their shyness and nervousness among their peers may keep them from being socially comfortable.  This program helps them present themselves with dignity and shows them how to be at ease with adults and with friends in all social situations.</p>
<p>This is a continuing program and every year it builds on the growth of the previous years. The curriculum changes with the level of maturity.  The seventh and eighth graders may review the Foxtrot while adding additional steps.  The Cha-cha might be replaced by a new Latin American dance such as the Mambo or the Tango.  Of course, each year general etiquette is thoroughly reviewed.</p>
<p>It is our belief that young people who practice proper etiquette from an early age will always feel socially secure, and those who learn to dance will love it for the rest of their lives!</p>
