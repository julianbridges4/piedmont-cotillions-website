		<h1>What is Cotillion?</h1>

		<p>Parents, do you have a child who enjoys spending time with friends and learning new things in a fun 		environment?  Do you have a child who needs to build self-confidence and learn how to navigate social 		situations with grace and proper etiquette?</span></p>

		<p>Students, do you enjoy spending time with your friends, having fun, dancing and learning a  little along the way?  Are you a 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th Grader? Well, then our cotillion classes are for YOU…</p>

		<p>Piedmont Cotillions offers intensive five-week cotillion programs in both the spring and fall of each year.  Our program is designed to introduce young adults in the 5th to 8th grade to the importance of social graces, and character education.  We instruct students in table manners, cell phone and social-networking etiquette, how to ask a lady to dance, how to navigate a receiving line and how to properly converse in social conversations.  We build confidence and aim to equip our graduates with the poise to handle any social situation.</p>

		<p>In addition, each class includes a lesson in ballroom dances such as the Foxtrot, Waltz, Tango and many other popular line dances.  For our older students, we feature theme nights like Country Western and Beach Night.  </p>

		<p>Piedmont Cotillions’ objective is for our students to learn etiquette and ballroom dancing while having fun in an enjoyable environment.  Our condensed five week program allows our young adults to participate in cotillion without conflicting with their other extracurricular activities.  Our program is one that parents feel good about sending their children to and one that the students get excited to attend.</p>

		<p>At the end of each program, each class is treated to a special night to celebrate graduation.  For our fifth and sixth graders all parents are cordially invited to attend the last class to observe and dance with their children.  Our seventh and eighth graders will enjoy a special class with a dance party on their last night. </p>

<p>Classes are scheduled in the evening and run for five weeks in the spring and fall of each year. Invitations will be mailed out a month prior to the start of class.  Girls wear Sunday dresses or skirts and white gloves. Boys wear sports coats and ties, dress pants, and hard-soled shoes.  Tuition varies by location.</p>
